libdfu: library for implementing Direct Firmware Update for several target
processors under several host environments.

Design should be modular, so that new programming hosts and targets can
be added quite easily.

Two hosts (linux pc and esp8266) and two targets (stm32-dfu and stk500 v1)
are currently supported.

Have a look in samples/ for some sample programs.

To build for linux pc:

make HOST=linux

To build for esp8266:

make

To enable debug prints build with DEBUG=y:

make DEBUG=y

Before building, setup a file named local_config.mk in the main sources
directory assigning values to the following make variables:

SDK_BASE
SAMPLES_SSID
SAMPLES_PASSWORD

SDK_BASE is the path of the esp8266 sdk you rely on (I'm using
esp_iot_sdk_v1.5.2).

SAMPLES_SSID and SAMPLE_PASSWORD are respectively the SSID and the password
of the wifi network the esp8266 shall connect to (these are only used by
sample programs).


This is currently work in progress and completely experimental.

Have fun
Davide
