libdfu: library for implementing Direct Firmware Update for several target
processors under several host environments.

Design should be modular, so that new programming hosts and targets can
be added quite easily.

Two hosts (linux pc and esp8266) and two targets (stm32-dfu and stk500 v1)
are currently supported.

Have a look in samples/ for some sample programs.

To build for linux pc:

make HOST=linux

To build for esp8266:

make

To enable debug prints build with DEBUG=y:

make DEBUG=y


This is currently work in progress and completely experimental.

Have fun
Davide
